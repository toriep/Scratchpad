        1/Store something
        2/What codes do I execute with the conditions at the moment
        Loops is the purpose of the computer. Loops just do something repeatedly as fast as possible
        Do while loop you do at least once before it checks
        while(this is true){
            do this
        }

        for(initiator;check to proceed:when does it stop, should i loops?;incrementor:where to go next){
            code block: work
            }

         initiator: where to start
         while (check to proceed: when does it stop, should i loop){
          code/work block
          incrementor: where to go next
          }

         you can put a function at the initiator or set several initiator
         the checker needs to be a number that starts true and ends false


         FOR IN LOOP

         var theObject = {
            name: 'tiny'
            weight: '100kg'
            }

          if you want all the keys, you do this
         for(var theKeyFromTheObject in theObject){
            console.log(theKeyFromTheObject);
            } ----> name weight

            if you want all the values, you do this
         for(var theKeyFromTheObject in theObject){
               theObject[theKeyFromTheObject]
            }

          Use theObject[theKeyFromTheObject] to retrieve ALL values in the object. This is for FOR IN loop only
          If i want a specific value then I do, theObject.specificKeyName

          You use while loop for things when you don't know when it ends


          WHILE LOOP
          while(true(checker)){
          DO THIS
          incrementor
          }

          this is akin to if(true){
          DO THIS ONCE
          }
