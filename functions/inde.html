        /*
        For variables, functions define their own scope
        You can only call a function within the scope it's in
        You can put any codes inside a function
        All javascript in a browser live in a window
        elements live in a document, also known as the dom
        parameters make local variables
        set whatever the functions returns to a variable instead of directly returning it
        console.log only goes to the console
        it's better to make many functions and call them within each other than one long ass function
        generally, you want the functions take in something and return something purely or change something, no side effect(which means it doesn't do many things inside it,
        eg. return and document.writeIn
        if you see the same codes in many places, then find a way to consolidate it
        the var keyword, and only it, hoists the declaration up to the top of the scope. the var keyword put the variable on top of the scope, but not
        the assignment, be it local or global scope
        functions are hoisted in their entirety. You can call them first
        lexical scope (the parental scope)
        there's only one definition of function but many places you can call it
        ! ONLY FUNCTIONS DEFINITION MAKE A SCOPE, NOT LOOPS, IF, SWITCH, WHATEVER
        You know if it's a local variable when there's a var something inside or a parameter
        functions can't see into each other's variables, you have to return it or make it a global variable
        ! Every time you run a function, it instantiates a new memory space, basically make a new space(new bubble)
        When you run a function, it makes a brand new copy, a brand new memory space
        When a function is run, its memory space is stored in its scope?
        It's based on where the function is defined, not called
        Where the scope is where the function is defined, where the curly bracket is
        if you specify a variable without var, you make it auto global
        variables without declaration only becomes global when it's called
        when a function ends, every variable inside of it is destroyed
        After the function runs, it makes its own copy again

        Find variables 3.5 rule IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            1/what scope is the variable in? have to know where you are to know what you have access to
            2/ Is there a LOCAL definition of that variable in this scope
            3/ If the answer is no, what is the lexical scope?
            4/ iS there a variable in the lexical scope?

            var result = num1+num2;
            return result;
        }

        function squareTheNumber(num,booolean) {
            var squaredNumber = num * num;
            if (booolean === true && num < 0) {
                squaredNumber *= -1;
            }
           return squaredNumber
