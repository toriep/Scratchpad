        objects do not return error even if it's empty because it still holds a memory space
        arrays can be sorted easily, objects cannot
        but objects can be looked up easily
        Objects are good for holding multiple key:value datas. It can specify key value and you can search through it. objects are good for finding
        something by a particular key
        Arrays have orders. If you want search something through an array, you have to loop through the entire thing
        Everything has a trade-off and a use case, that's why there're different languages and there's array and object
        Use objects when you care about where things belong, which keys go to
        The con to object is that it's harder to add things arbitrarily
        Use arrays for when you care about order (eg. prioritizing) and when you absolutely don't (eg. list of ingredients)
        Use arrays to quickly store and remove it
        .slice() creates a copy of the array, an actually new array
