        /*dom manipulation = changing the html document
        Use Jquery whenever you're manipulating the dom
        Either
        reference error of $ mean Jquery is not loaded
        if jquery is loaded, $ will be defined. If it's not loaded, $ will not be defined
        we have to wrap element form dom select because div or p is variable to JS and it doesn't know what the heck it is
        if you want to change CSS with jquery, add class first because you can remove it later
        When you don't add a class and you use jquery to change CSS, the old CSS is obliterated, gone. It doesn't revert back to the set color, assuming you have the same class??
        You change inline when the style only affects one thing
        To select all elements, you can use * or 'body'
        .text either adds or grabs a text.
        .text() grabs text but .text('balladkdkfjlkdjflkd') changes text
        Chaining is not a jquery thing but JS thing
        Don't use .html because you allow any user input to enter your site, which would make it easier for any codes to be hacked
        Don't ever use eval because it forces any codes to run
        width and height in jquery function tells how wide or high an element is
        look up Jquery method list
        Don't use toggle if you only want to hide it, because if it's hidden then it'll be shown
        .find looks inside element, eg. body, to find something else. With .find you can use use variable substitution eg. var element = $("body")
        .parent goes up to the parent of the selected element and select the parent
        .parent selects upwards
